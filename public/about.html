<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Arika Adams. I am a single mother to one amazing little girl and I am currently residing in Arizona. I am
   originally from California, Pomona to be exact, and grew up between there and Hawaii. I attended elementary school in
  both states then migrated to Las Vegas where I graduated hich school.   </p>

<p>Some of my favorite pastimes are to cook and listen to music. I love the outdoors and  acan be an absolute fish in the 
  water. I love warm sunny days, and am learning to do yoga and meditate.  </p>

<p>I have big dreams of living abroad and showing my daughter a different way of life. My health is increasingly becoming 
  top priority in my life as I am learning to heal hollistically. Ideally I would love to move somewhere tropical with great
  weather, organic food, and lots of culture, learn to do things a different way. Thailand would be amazing! I have also 
  considered Africa as an option and love the idea of living there. We shall see what the future holds.! </p>
